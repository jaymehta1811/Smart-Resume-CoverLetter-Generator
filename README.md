## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Input Processing**
- Users paste their resume content and list their skills
- Job title and description are entered for target role
- Text is processed to extract keywords and technical skills

### 2. **Matching Algorithm**
```javascript
// Weighted scoring formula
finalScore = (skillMatchPercentage * 0.7) + (keywordMatchPercentage * 0.3)

// Skill matching
matchedSkills = requiredSkills ∩ (resumeSkills ∪ userSkills)
skillMatchPercentage = (matchedSkills.length / requiredSkills.length) * 100
```

### 3. **Content Generation**
- **Resume Summary**: Tailored based on job requirements and user experience
- **Cover Letter**: Professional template with personalized content
- **Skill Analysis**: Gap identification with learning resource recommendations

### 4. **Results Display**
- Visual compatibility score with color coding
- Matched vs missing skills comparison
- Generated content with copy-to-clipboard functionality
